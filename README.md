This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

Hello, I was looking at some projects at https://cmpm-121-demo-1-fall-2024.glitch.me/ to give me more inspiration about what to add to my game.

https://kami-lel.github.io/ucsc-cmpm121-demo1/ The game Burger Cooking Mania showed me that I should add a counter to each purchase to show the user how many of the items they bought.

https://blujai831.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/ Feed the fire! The game Feed the Fire gave me inspiration to make the buttons hidden until you can purchase them.
